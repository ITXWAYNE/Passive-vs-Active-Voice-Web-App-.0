        <h2>Lesson Objectives</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Understand the difference between active and passive voice.</li>
            <li>Convert sentences from active to passive and vice versa.</li>
            <li>Know when to use the passive voice effectively.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>1. What Is Voice in Grammar?</h2>
        <p>
            In grammar, <strong>voice</strong> shows whether the subject of a sentence is doing an action or receiving it. 
            The two main voices in English are:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Active voice:</strong> The subject performs the action.</li>
            <li><strong>Passive voice:</strong> The subject receives the action.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>2. Active Voice</h2>
        <p><strong>Definition:</strong> The subject performs the action of the verb.</p>
        <p><strong>Structure:</strong> Subject + Verb + Object</p>
        <ul>
            <li>The cat chased the mouse.</li>
            <li>Maria writes a letter.</li>
            <li>The teacher gave us homework.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>3. Passive Voice</h2>
        <p><strong>Definition:</strong> The subject receives the action. The agent (doer) can be added using <em>by</em>.</p>
        <p><strong>Structure:</strong> Subject + (form of "be") + Past Participle + (by + Agent)</p>
        <ul>
            <li>The mouse was chased (by the cat).</li>
            <li>A letter was written (by Maria).</li>
            <li>Homework was given (by the teacher).</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>4. How to Convert Active to Passive Voice</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Identify the subject, verb, and object.</li>
            <li>Make the object of the active sentence the subject of the passive sentence.</li>
            <li>Use the correct form of <em>be</em> + past participle.</li>
            <li>Optionally include <em>by + agent</em>.</li>
            <li>Adjust tense accordingly.</li>
        </ol>

        <p><strong>Example:</strong></p>
        <p>
            Active: The students <strong>read</strong> the book.<br>
            Passive: The book <strong>was read</strong> (by the students).
        </p>

        <p>For complex tenses:</p>
        <p>
            Active: The committee <strong>is evaluating</strong> the proposal.<br>
            Passive: The proposal <strong>is being evaluated</strong> (by the committee).
        </p>

        <h2>5. When to Use Passive Voice</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>When the doer is unknown or unimportant.</li>
            <li>When focusing on the action or the receiver.</li>
            <li>In formal or scientific writing.</li>
            <li>To sound polite or indirect (e.g., “Mistakes were made.”).</li>
        </ul>
